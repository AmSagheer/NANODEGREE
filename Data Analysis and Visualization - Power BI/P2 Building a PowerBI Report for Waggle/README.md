# **Waggle Power BI Report**

## Project Description:

Waggle is a startup specializing in innovative smart devices for pets. They are currently experiencing tremendous excitement and satisfaction due to the success of their latest product, the Lapdog device. This fitness collar enables pet owners to monitor their dog's activity, receive alerts for walk times, and even provides flea-repelling functionality. The product has garnered exceptional reviews, witnessed a surge in sales, and, most importantly, has proven its effectiveness.

The product team has taken a significant step by distributing 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Following months of rigorous data collection, our mission is to create a polished Power BI report suitable for the boardroom. This report will narrate the narrative of how the Lapcat data stacks up against the insights derived from the Lapdog collar devices. Its purpose is to either persuade the CEO that Lapcat is poised to become the next major success or to provide valuable insights that can help steer clear of a costly mistake.

Below is a quick demonestration about the project steps:

### Data Model:

### Report Requirements:
The CEO is interested in uncovering answers to the following questions:
- Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device similarly to dogs?
- Did Lapcat device owners report a comparable level of satisfaction as Lapdog device owners?
- The report should align with our brand identity. This entails using colors exclusively from the Waggle color palette, incorporating the Waggle logo, and including other authorized company logos and icons to maintain a cohesive and "on-brand" appearance.(Provided by Udacity)
- The product team has placed their trust in us to include additional visuals and insights as we deem appropriate. However, their primary focus lies in comparisons between dogs and cats using Waggle devices and gathering insights about the families who own these pets. Furthermore, they have expressed interest in having slicers incorporated into the report, allowing them to filter and explore the data independently to gain a deeper understanding of the findings.

- The report will incorporate the following elements:

1- **Slicers:** Each page will feature at least five slicers, demonstrating a variety of slicer types, including:

- A drop-down slicer
- A slider slicer
- A hierarchy slicer
- A slicer with "Select All" enabled
- A slicer with the search box enabled

2- **Bookmark Features:** There will be at least two bookmark features:

- One bookmark will enable users to dynamically switch one visual with a different one.
- Another bookmark will allow users to reset all applied filters on the page.

3 - **Navigation Buttons:** The report will include buttons to facilitate user navigation between report tabs. These buttons will be designed to respond visually, changing color or size when users hover over them.

The Power BI report will consist of three tabs:

1- **CEO's Questions:**

This first page will prominently address the CEO's business questions, emphasizing the disparities in average step count and average user rating between Lapdog and Lapcat devices.

2- **Pet Insights:**

The second page will be dedicated to insights concerning pets utilizing the device. It will provide comprehensive data and visualizations related to pet activity, health, and behavior.

3- **Family Insights:**

The third page will delve into insights regarding the families that own the pets. It will explore demographic and behavioral data about the pet owners, providing a holistic view of the user base.
