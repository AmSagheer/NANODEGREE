# **Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain**


## Project Description:
he online national clothing chain is facing stagnant sales and is seeking assistance in formulating a targeted marketing campaign. Their primary objective is to re-engage customers who have previously disengaged.

They aim to promote particular products to specific customers in specific geographic locations. However, they currently lack the information needed to identify the right audience to target for this campaign.

## Data Sources
The project will use a variety of data sources, including
- US Census Bureau
  - Average income
  - location
  - population
  - industry

- Business Data
  - Product inventory
  - Product prices
  - Customer rating
  - Product return rate
  
- Customer Data
  - Customer ID
  - Names
  - Location
  - Date of birth
  - Purchase history
  

## Project requirements

In this project, we will leverage population statistics sourced from the US Census Bureau to identify regions with the highest income levels across the country. Our goal is to investigate whether a correlation exists between sales and income in these areas. Although we do not possess direct knowledge of our customers' incomes, we plan to predict this information by examining their purchase history and geographic locations and comparing it to the census data.

Furthermore, we aim to conduct an in-depth analysis of our inventory, with a specific focus on customer ratings and return rates. The objective here is to determine if there is any noticeable correlation between these two factors, shedding light on potential insights related to product quality and customer satisfaction.


## Data Model

## Analysis Questions
1. What is the correlation (R2 value) between sales and income?
2. What is the correlation (R2 value) between customer ratings and product return rate?
3. What are the linear regression formulas to predict customer income from customer sales?
